# Sogrom's Table Tools: Developer Guide

This guide is for macro authors, module developers and contributors. It documents the module's public API, the data it
stores on documents, its settings and socket messages, and how the code and tests are laid out.

What the module does from the table's side is in the [player guide](README.md) and the [GM Guide](GM.md). How to
contribute (sign-off, commit messages, pull requests) is in [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).

## At a glance

| | |
|---|---|
| Module ID | `sogrom-table-tools` |
| Requires | Foundry VTT v14, D&D 5e 6.x (verified on 6.0.5) |
| API | `game.modules.get("sogrom-table-tools").api`, set during `init` |
| Flag scope | `sogrom-table-tools` |
| Socket | `module.sogrom-table-tools` |
| Language file | `lang/en.json`, every key under `STT` |

## The API

```js
const api = game.modules.get("sogrom-table-tools").api;
// { requestRolls, createRequest }
```

The API object is assigned in the `init` hook, so it is available from `setup` onwards, and in any macro.

Only these two functions are public. The modules in `scripts/` export other helpers, which the tests import directly,
but those are internal and may change in any release.

### `requestRolls()`

Opens the **Request Rolls** window, as the tankard button in the chat controls does. If the window is already
open, it is brought to the front, keeping what the GM has filled in.

| | |
|---|---|
| Returns | The `RollRequestConfig` application (an `ApplicationV2`), or `undefined` for a non-GM user. |
| Who | GM only. For anyone else it does nothing. |

```js
game.modules.get("sogrom-table-tools").api.requestRolls();
```

### `createRequest(request)`

Posts a roll request to chat without the window.

| | |
|---|---|
| Parameters | `request`: a [request object](#the-request-object). Anything the window always fills in may be left out. |
| Returns | `Promise<ChatMessage5e>`: the request's chat message. |
| Throws | `Error`, with a translated message, if the user isn't a GM or the request can't be rolled. Nothing is posted. |

It fills in the defaults, [validates](#validation) the request, drops any rolls (`parts`) beyond the number its mode
uses, and creates a chat message spoken by "Sogrom's Table Tools" with the request in `flags["sogrom-table-tools"].request`. Only a
message authored by a GM is drawn as a request card, so a player can't forge one by writing the flag themselves.

### The request object

```ts
interface RollRequest {
  mode: "standard" | "team" | "challenge" | "rolloff" | "versus" | "divine";
  parts: RequestPart[];      // the rolls: see the table below for how many
  actors: string[];          // actor UUIDs of everyone in the request, each once
  sides?: [string[], string[]]; // contests only: actor UUIDs on each side
  successes?: number;        // "challenge" only: successes needed, 1–3 (default 2)
  range?: number;            // "divine" only: how many numbers each actor picks, 1–50 (default 16)
  showDC?: boolean;          // show the DC to players (default: the "showDCDefault" setting)
  rollMode?: "public" | "gm"; // "gm" is a private GM roll (default "public")
}

interface RequestPart {
  type: "skill" | "check" | "save" | "tool" | "death" | "d20" | "d6" | "d8" | "d10" | "d12" | "d100";
  key?: string | null;       // the skill, ability or tool ID; omitted or null for a plain die
  dc: number | null;         // null for no DC
  alternatives?: { type: string, key?: string | null, dc?: number | null }[]; // other rolls the actor may make instead
}
```

**Modes**

| `mode` | Window label | `parts` used | `sides` | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `standard` | Standard Roll | 1 | | Each actor rolls once against the DC. Allows `alternatives`, and a `death` part with none. |
| `team` | Team Challenge | 1 | | The average of everyone's totals, rounded down, against the DC. Each natural 1 removes the highest roll, each natural 20 the lowest. Allows `alternatives`. |
| `challenge` | Skill Challenge | 3 | | Three rolls in turn, each with its own DC; `successes` of them needed. Allows `alternatives`. |
| `rolloff` | Roll-Off | 2 (one per side) | Required, exactly one actor each | Higher total wins. An actor no player owns rolls as a private GM roll until the GM shows it. |
| `versus` | Team vs Team | 2 (one per side) | Required, at least one actor each | Each side pooled like a Team Challenge; higher average wins. |
| `divine` | Divine Intervention | 1, which must be `d100` | | Each actor picks `range` numbers in a row from 1 to 100, then must roll one of them. `dc` is ignored. |

**Part types and keys**

| `type` | `key` | Rolled with |
|---|---|---|
| `skill` | A key of `CONFIG.DND5E.skills`, e.g. `"ath"`, `"ste"`, `"prc"` | `actor.rollSkill` |
| `check` | A key of `CONFIG.DND5E.abilities`, e.g. `"str"` | `actor.rollAbilityCheck` |
| `save` | A key of `CONFIG.DND5E.abilities`, e.g. `"dex"` | `actor.rollSavingThrow` |
| `tool` | A key of `CONFIG.DND5E.tools`, e.g. `"thief"` | `actor.rollToolCheck` |
| `death` | none | `actor.rollDeathSave`, so dnd5e records the success or failure on the actor. Only in a `standard` request, with no `alternatives`; give it `dc: 10` for the card to show pass or fail. |
| `d20` | none | dnd5e's d20 test, so advantage, the roll window and the cards apply |
| `d6` `d8` `d10` `d12` `d100` | none | A plain roll |

The window offers each mode only some dice (Team vs Team offers only `d20`, for example), but `createRequest` accepts
any of them in any mode except `divine`.

**Alternatives.** In `standard`, `team` and `challenge`, a part may list up to three `alternatives`, so an actor
chooses between up to four rolls. The roll message records which was made in `requestRoll.choice`.

In `standard` and `challenge`, an alternative may give a `dc` of its own: a number, or `null` for none. An
alternative with no `dc` key shares the part's `dc`, as every alternative used to, so older requests and macros
score as they did. In `team`, whose rolls are averaged against one DC, an alternative can't give a `dc`. Use
`getChoiceDC(part, choice)` from `scripts/roll-requests.mjs` if you need the DC a roll was made against; it is internal,
like the module's other exports.

**Defaults.** `withDefaults` fills in a missing or `null` value for `rollMode` (`"public"`), `showDC` (the
`showDCDefault` setting), `successes` (`2`, for `challenge`) and `range` (`16`, for `divine`). Nothing else is filled
in.

### Validation

`createRequest` throws an `Error` with one of these messages (from `lang/en.json`, so they follow the user's
language), and posts nothing:

| Problem | Message |
|---|---|
| The user isn't a GM | Only a GM can post a roll request. |
| `mode` isn't one of the six | Unknown kind of roll request: {mode}. |
| `actors` isn't an array of unique, non-empty strings | A roll request's actors must be a list of actor UUIDs, each named once. |
| `actors` is empty | A roll request needs at least one actor to roll. |
| `rollMode` isn't `"public"` or `"gm"` | Unknown roll visibility: {rollMode}. Use "public" or "gm". |
| A contest's `sides` aren't two non-empty arrays | Each side of a contest needs at least one actor. |
| A `rolloff` side has more than one actor | Each side of a Roll-Off needs exactly one actor. |
| Someone on a side isn't in `actors` | Everyone on a side of a contest must also be in the request's actors. |
| Fewer `parts` than the mode uses | A roll request is missing a roll. |
| `alternatives` in a mode without choices, three or more of them, or not objects | Only a Standard Roll, Team Challenge or Skill Challenge can offer a choice of rolls, and at most 4 to choose from, given as a list of alternatives. |
| An alternative with a `dc` in a `team` request | A Team Challenge's rolls are averaged against one DC, so its alternatives can't have DCs of their own. |
| A `death` roll outside a `standard` request, or with alternatives, or as one | A death save can only be asked for in a Standard Roll, with no other rolls to choose from. |
| An unknown `type` | Unknown kind of roll: {type}. |
| A `key` that dnd5e doesn't know | Unknown {type} for a roll: {key}. Use one of: {keys}. |
| A `dc`, on a part or an alternative, that's neither a number nor `null` | A DC must be a number, or null for none: {dc}. |
| `successes` not an integer from 1 to 3 | A skill challenge needs from 1 to 3 successes, not {successes}. |
| `range` not an integer from 1 to 50 | Divine Intervention needs from 1 to 50 numbers to pick, not {range}. |
| A `divine` part that isn't `d100` | Divine Intervention's roll is a d100, not {type}. |

Actor UUIDs are checked for shape only: `createRequest` doesn't check that each actor exists.

### Examples

Each example assumes:

```js
const { createRequest } = game.modules.get("sogrom-table-tools").api;
const uuid = name => game.actors.getName(name).uuid;
const party = game.actors.filter(a => a.hasPlayerOwner && (a.type === "character")).map(a => a.uuid);
```

**Standard Roll, a DC 15 Athletics check, with the DC shown:**

```js
await createRequest({
  mode: "standard",
  parts: [{ type: "skill", key: "ath", dc: 15 }],
  actors: party,
  showDC: true
});
```

**Standard Roll with a choice, Persuasion or Deception, sharing DC 14, as a private GM roll:**

```js
await createRequest({
  mode: "standard",
  parts: [{ type: "skill", key: "per", dc: 14, alternatives: [{ type: "skill", key: "dec" }] }],
  actors: party,
  rollMode: "gm"
});
```

**Standard Roll with a choice, each at its own DC: a DC 10 Dexterity save or a DC 15 Strength save:**

```js
await createRequest({
  mode: "standard",
  parts: [{ type: "save", key: "dex", dc: 10, alternatives: [{ type: "save", key: "str", dc: 15 }] }],
  actors: party
});
```

**A plain d20 with no DC:**

```js
await createRequest({ mode: "standard", parts: [{ type: "d20", dc: null }], actors: party });
```

**A death save, for a character at 0 hit points:**

```js
await createRequest({ mode: "standard", parts: [{ type: "death", dc: 10 }], actors: [uuid("Aria")], showDC: true });
```

**Team Challenge, a DC 13 Stealth check:**

```js
await createRequest({ mode: "team", parts: [{ type: "skill", key: "ste", dc: 13 }], actors: party });
```

**Skill Challenge, all three needed:**

```js
await createRequest({
  mode: "challenge",
  successes: 3,
  parts: [
    { type: "skill", key: "ath", dc: 12 },
    { type: "skill", key: "sur", dc: 14 },
    { type: "save", key: "con", dc: 13 }
  ],
  actors: party
});
```

**Roll-Off, a player character's d100 against a monster's Athletics check:**

```js
const aria = uuid("Aria");
const ogre = uuid("Ogre");
await createRequest({
  mode: "rolloff",
  parts: [{ type: "d100", dc: null }, { type: "skill", key: "ath", dc: null }],
  sides: [[aria], [ogre]],
  actors: [aria, ogre]
});
```

**Team vs Team, the party's Strength checks against the goblins':**

```js
const goblins = canvas.tokens.placeables.filter(t => t.actor?.name === "Goblin").map(t => t.actor.uuid);
await createRequest({
  mode: "versus",
  parts: [{ type: "check", key: "str", dc: null }, { type: "check", key: "str", dc: null }],
  sides: [party, goblins],
  actors: [...party, ...goblins]
});
```

**Divine Intervention, ten numbers each:**

```js
await createRequest({ mode: "divine", range: 10, parts: [{ type: "d100", dc: null }], actors: [uuid("Aria")] });
```

**Handling a refusal:**

```js
try {
  await createRequest({ mode: "standard", parts: [{ type: "skill", key: "athletics", dc: 12 }], actors: party });
} catch ( err ) {
  ui.notifications.error(err.message); // "Unknown skill for a roll: athletics. Use one of: acr, ani, arc, …"
}
```

## Data stored on documents

Everything Sogrom's Table Tools stores is in flags under `sogrom-table-tools`. Results are never stored on a request: the card works
them out from its roll messages each time it draws.

### On a request message

| Flag | Type | Written by | Meaning |
|---|---|---|---|
| `request` | `RollRequest` | `createRequest`, or the window | The request, with defaults filled in. Only honoured on a GM's message. Changing the DC from the card rewrites `request.parts[n].dc`, or an alternative's `dc`. |
| `revealed` | `boolean` | The GM's **Show to players** button | Whether players see the results and summary. Unset means hidden. A death save request is posted with it set. |
| `deathSave` | `{ actor: string, combat: string, round: number }` | `death-saves.mjs` | Marks a death save request posted at the start of a turn: the actor's UUID, and the combat and round it was posted for, so a turn started again posts no second request. |

### On a roll made for a request

| Flag | Type | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `requestRoll.request` | `string` | The request message's ID. |
| `requestRoll.actor` | `string` | The UUID of the actor rolled for. |
| `requestRoll.part` | `number` | Index into `request.parts`. In a contest this is the side. |
| `requestRoll.choice` | `number` | Which of the part's rolls was made: `0` for its own, `1` onwards for an alternative. |
| `requestRoll.range` | `{ start: number, end: number }` | Divine Intervention only: the numbers picked. |

The flag is written by whoever rolls, so the card trusts none of it. A roll only counts if its author is a GM or an
owner of `actor`, its `part` exists, its actor is on that side in a contest, and, for Divine Intervention, its range is
exactly `request.range` numbers within 1 to 100. If an actor has more than one roll for the same part, the earliest
counts. The DC is never put on the roll itself, so dnd5e doesn't show players success or failure; the card scores each
roll against the request's DC.

### On any roll a card, die or feature changed

| Flag | Type | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `log` | `LogEntry[]` | One entry per change, oldest first, drawn as notes under the roll. |

```ts
interface LogEntry {
  text: string;   // e.g. "Luck: rerolled the d20 (4 → 13): 4 → 13"
  card: string;   // the card's or feature's name
  by: string;     // the name of the actor who played it
  img?: string;   // a Hero Card's art. A new entry with `img` is shown on screen to everyone who can see the roll.
  icon?: string;  // Font Awesome classes, for entries without art: bonus dice and the Fighter's Indomitable
}
```

Entries written before 2.0.0 are plain strings, and are still drawn.

The roll's `rolls` are rewritten in place in the same update, so the message keeps its place in chat and dnd5e works
out hit, miss and save results again.

### On a bonus die that has been spent

| Flag | Type | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `bonusUsed` | `{ target: string, sign: 1 \| -1 }` | The roll it was added to (`1`) or subtracted from (`-1`), described for its note. A message with this flag can't be spent again. |

### On an actor

| Flag | Type | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `advantage` | `true` | The Advantage card was played from the sheet. The next d20 test gets advantage, and the flag is cleared once that roll is confirmed. |
| `stable` | `boolean` | Set in the same update as a death save that stabilizes the actor, while `deathSavePrompt` is on, since dnd5e clears the successes and leaves nothing else to show it. Set to `false` when the actor is healed or takes a death save failure. While `true`, no death save is asked for. |

## Settings

All are world settings, read with `game.settings.get("sogrom-table-tools", key)`. None is listed in **Configure
Settings** itself: they're grouped into four menus there (`heroCards`, `diceRolling`, `rollRequests` and `worldScripts`), registered
in `settings-menus.mjs`. A setting is added to a menu through its class's `SETTINGS`.

| Key | Type | Default | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| `lockNaturals` | Boolean | `true` | No card can be played on a natural 1 or 20. |
| `markNaturals` | Boolean | `true` | Ring natural 1s and 20s in chat and on request cards. |
| `naturalSaves` | Boolean | `true` | A natural 20 on a save against an activity's damage takes none, and a natural 1 takes its maximum, ignoring resistances and immunities. |
| `showPlayedCards` | Boolean | `true` | Show played cards' art on screen. |
| `showDCDefault` | Boolean | `false` | Whether **Show DC to Players** starts ticked, and the default for `createRequest`'s `showDC`. |
| `attachRolls` | Boolean | `true` | Draw requested rolls on the request card and hide their own messages. Changing it redraws every request and roll. |
| `popupPlayers` | Boolean | `false` | Open a pop-up for each player in a request. |
| `popupGM` | Boolean | `false` | Open a pop-up for the GM, for actors no player owns. |
| `deathSavePrompt` | Boolean | `false` | Post a death save request at the start of a dying creature's turn in combat. |
| `bloodiedTint` | Boolean | `false` | Add a red token tint and ring background to D&D 5e's Bloodied effect as it's created. |
| `fadeUnprepared` | Boolean | `false` | Fade unprepared, preparable spells of level 1 or higher on actor sheets. |
| `rarityColours` | Boolean | `false` | Tint item rows on actor sheets by rarity. |
| `oneTabActivities` | Boolean | `false` | Lay an activity sheet's tabs side by side, through the `stt-one-tab-activities` body class. |
| `chatButtonLabels` | Boolean | `false` | Show icon buttons' labels on compact chat cards, through the `stt-chat-button-labels` body class. |

## Socket messages

The manifest sets `"socket": true`, and the module listens on `module.sogrom-table-tools` from `ready`. Bonus dice use
it: a player can add a die to a roll they can see but can't update, such as a monster's, and the active GM's client
makes the change.

| `action` | Sent by | To | Payload | Effect |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `applyBonus` | The player spending the die | The active GM only | `{ source, target, sign }`: the bonus and target message IDs, and `1` or `-1` | The GM's client checks the request again as the sender, whose ID Foundry's server supplies, then applies it. With no GM online, nothing is sent and the player is warned. |
| `bonusNotApplied` | The active GM | The sender only | `{ reason: "invalid" \| "error" }` | Warns the player that the GM refused it or couldn't apply it. The die isn't spent. |

## How the Hero Cards are found

An item is a Hero Cards feature if any of these is true:

- its `system.identifier` is `hero-cards`;
- its `_stats.compendiumSource` ends with the compendium item's ID, `xFVsPIjSASjXaqUO`;
- its name is exactly `Hero Cards`.

Each card is an activity on that item, with one use recovered on a long rest. The cards that change a roll are
recognised by activity ID, falling back to the activity's name, case-insensitively:

| Card | Activity IDs | Name | Rolls it can be played on |
|---|---|---|---|
| Inspiration | `iE0w9Rp70zne6zuJ`, `na7uWxkaPiGn00ZK`, `l1s90u72J3Q34HFN` | `inspiration - 1d6` / `1d8` / `1d10` | attack, damage, check, save, initiative |
| Luck | `uPqHABvpmYZr0ASg` | `luck` | attack, damage, check, save, initiative, divine |
| Advantage | `OkUWoFMxuyT5TxX7` | `advantage` | attack, check, save, initiative, divine |
| Indomitable | `aE8dyIQUgvXfcu3M` | `indomitable` | save (a known failure) |
| Relentless | `28kjjOyF9Suf3hkq` | `relentless` | initiative (in combat round 1) |

The art for every card, including those played only from the sheet, is in `assets/images`, mapped by activity name in
`CARD_ART` in `scripts/hero-cards.mjs`. An activity with no mapped art uses its own icon.

A roll's kind comes from its chat message: dnd5e's `attack`, `damage`, `check` (or `initiative`) and `save` (not
death saves) message types; a Divine Intervention d100 from a request; and a plain d20 made for a request, which is
treated as a check.

## Hooks and integration points

Sogrom's Table Tools fires no hooks of its own. It listens to these:

| Hook | Script | Why |
|---|---|---|
| `init` | `hero-cards.mjs`, `roll-requests.mjs`, `roll-request-popup.mjs`, `death-saves.mjs`, `settings-menus.mjs` | Register settings and their menus, and set the API. |
| `setup` | `hero-cards.mjs`, `natural-saves.mjs` | Wrap `Item#use` and the damage tray's target options (see below). |
| `ready` | `bonus-rolls.mjs`, `roll-request-popup.mjs` | Start listening on the socket, and open pop-ups for recent requests. |
| `dnd5e.renderChatMessage` | `hero-cards.mjs`, `roll-requests.mjs`, `bonus-rolls.mjs`, `class-features.mjs` | Add card buttons, natural 1/20 rings, notes, request cards, and the Indomitable button. |
| `createChatMessage`, `updateChatMessage`, `deleteChatMessage` | `hero-cards.mjs`, `roll-requests.mjs`, `roll-request-popup.mjs` | Show played cards, redraw request cards, and open or close pop-ups. |
| `dnd5e.preCalculateDamage` | `natural-saves.mjs` | Raise each damage to its maximum for a target the damage tray marked for it. |
| `preDeleteChatMessage` | `roll-requests.mjs` | Stop players deleting a roll made for a request. |
| `getChatMessageContextOptions` | `bonus-rolls.mjs`, `class-features.mjs` | Add **Add to a roll…**, **Subtract from a roll…** and **Use Indomitable** to the right-click menu. |
| `renderChatInput` | `roll-requests.mjs` | Add the GM's tankard button to the chat controls. |
| `combatTurnChange` | `death-saves.mjs` | On the active GM's client, post a death save request for the creature whose turn started, while `deathSavePrompt` is on. |
| `dnd5e.rollDeathSave` | `death-saves.mjs` | Add the `stable` flag to the updates of a save that stabilizes the actor. |
| `preUpdateActor`, `updateActor` | `death-saves.mjs` | Clear the `stable` flag when the actor is healed or takes a failure, and remove its unrolled death save requests when it is healed. |
| `preCreateActiveEffect` | `bloodied-tint.mjs` | Add the tint to a Bloodied effect, while `bloodiedTint` is on. |
| `renderBaseActorSheet` | `fade-unprepared.mjs`, `rarity-colours.mjs` | Fade unprepared spells, and tint items by rarity, while their settings are on. |
| `getSceneControlButtons` | `roll-requests.mjs` | Add **Request Rolls** to the token controls. |
| `dnd5e.postUseActivity` | `hero-cards.mjs` | Note an Advantage card played from the sheet. |
| `dnd5e.preRollD20TestV2`, `dnd5e.postD20TestRollConfiguration` | `hero-cards.mjs` | Apply, then clear, that pending advantage. |

**`Item#use` is wrapped.** dnd5e has no hook before its list of an item's activities, so Sogrom's Table Tools replaces
`CONFIG.Item.documentClass.prototype.use` at `setup`. For a Hero Cards item it opens the card window instead.
Shift-click, or any other item, goes to the original. A module that wraps `Item#use` itself sees the module's wrapper
as the original.

**The damage tray's target options are wrapped.** dnd5e's `damage-application` element keeps each target's options
private, so Sogrom's Table Tools replaces its `getTargetOptions` at `setup`, giving each target its starting options the first time
the tray asks for them. A natural 20 gets a multiplier of `0`. A natural 1 gets a multiplier of `1`, its resistances and
immunities in `ignore.resistance` and `ignore.immunity`, and `{ "sogrom-table-tools": { maximize: true } }`, which the
`dnd5e.preCalculateDamage` hook reads to put each damage at its maximum, from the message's rolls evaluated with
`maximize`. Changes the GM makes in the tray afterwards are left alone.

**Rolls are changed in place.** A card, a bonus die or Indomitable rebuilds the message's `rolls` and updates the
message, rather than posting a new one. A module that caches a roll message's totals should listen to
`updateChatMessage`.

**Dice So Nice.** Dice rolled by a card or by Indomitable are shown with the speaker's dice appearance, so they look
like the roll they change.

## Development

### Setting up

```sh
npm install        # dev tooling only; nothing here ships in the module archive
npm run check      # manifest validation, lint and unit tests, as CI runs them
```

Link the repository into Foundry's `Data/modules` folder as `sogrom-table-tools`, then build the compendiums. See
[CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md#getting-set-up) for the commands.

### Compendium packs

The packs are committed as YAML in `src/packs/`, one file per document, and built into the LevelDB folders in
`packs/` that Foundry reads. Close Foundry before either command.

```sh
npm run build:packs     # YAML → packs/, after cloning or pulling
npm run extract:packs   # packs/ → YAML, after editing the packs in Foundry; then commit src/packs/
```

### Tests

| Command | What it runs |
|---|---|
| `npm test` | Unit tests of the rules (`test/`), with Foundry shimmed. No Foundry needed. |
| `npm run test:e2e` | End-to-end tests (`test-e2e/`) in a real Foundry, with a GM and a player in two browsers and the dice forced. |
| `npm run test:e2e -- divine` | Only the end-to-end tests whose name contains "divine". |
| `npm run lint` | ESLint, with no warnings allowed. |

The end-to-end harness needs a local Foundry install: copy `test-e2e/config.example.mjs` to `test-e2e/config.mjs`
and set the paths. [test-e2e/README.md](test-e2e/README.md) explains the setup, the test world and its fixtures, and
what each file tests. Add tests for new features, and run both suites before opening a pull request.

### Screenshots

The images in `docs/images/` are taken from a real Foundry by `test-e2e/screenshots.mjs`, with the same harness and
fixtures as the end-to-end tests, and forced dice, so every run takes the same pictures. Take them again after
changing anything they show:

```sh
npm run docs:screenshots            # every screenshot
npm run docs:screenshots -- divine  # only those whose name contains "divine"
```

They are saved as WebP at twice the screen's resolution. Add a `shot()` to the script for any new screenshot the
guides use.

### Releasing

Publishing a GitHub release, tagged `v1.2.3` or `1.2.3`, runs `.github/workflows/main.yml`. It fills in the version
and URLs in `module.json`,
runs `npm run check`, builds the packs, and attaches `module.json` and `module.zip` to the release. The archive holds
only what the module needs at runtime, as listed in the workflow's `zip` step; the guides (the README included), the
screenshots and the dev tooling aren't in it. Record user-facing changes in [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md).
